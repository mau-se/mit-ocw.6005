MitOCW.6005
===========

My solutions to Mit's OCW 6.005 course. I've coded with Java before but I hope this class will brush up my Java skills. I don't have a time frame for completing this but I expect to finish in 3-4 weeks. Only solutions to problem sets and assignments will be in this repository.
