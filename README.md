MitOCW.6005
===========

My solutions to Mit's OCW 6.005 course. I've coded with Java before but I hope this class will brush up my Java skills. I don't have a time frame for completing the course problems. Solutions to problem sets (may include those presented in lectures) and assignments will be found in this repository.
